            "comment": "This matchup is moderately favorable for **Alistar**. Zoe is dangerous with her poke and burst damage, but **Alistar**'s crowd control, **Exhaust**, and **Ignite** can reduce her threat significantly. If you avoid her skillshots and engage after she uses her **Portal Jump (E)** or when her abilities are on cooldown, you can win the fight and prevent her from kiting or escaping."

            "comment": "Ghost can help you close the gap on Zyra, but be cautious of her crowd control abilities, especially her **Grasping Roots (Q)**. **Ghost** is useful for sticking to her in case she tries to poke and retreat, but you need to be mindful of her **Stranglethorns (R)**, as it can easily turn a fight in her favor if you engage poorly. Timing is key when using **Ghost** to avoid getting caught in her crowd control."

            "comment": "Flash is crucial in this matchup to dodge Zyra’s **Grasping Roots (Q)** or **Stranglethorns (R)**. **Flash** allows you to reposition and avoid her crowd control or engage on her if she mispositions. Her **Grasping Roots (Q)** and **Stranglethorns (R)** are the main threats, so using **Flash** to dodge them gives you a major advantage, especially in the laning phase."

            "comment": "Ignite is useful against Zyra, as it prevents her from healing with **Revitalize** or item-based sustain. It also helps finish her off after an engage, as she tends to be squishy. **Ignite** can also reduce the impact of her **Grasping Roots (Q)** and prevent her from regenerating health after a trade, making it easier to burst her down in extended skirmishes."

            "comment": "Heal can provide sustain against Zyra’s poke, especially when she uses her **Grasping Roots (Q)** and **Deadly Spines (E)** to trade. However, **Exhaust** is usually a better option to reduce her burst damage and prevent her from kiting you with her **Stranglethorns (R)**. **Heal** can help you survive the poke, but **Exhaust** will do more to mitigate her threat in all-ins."

            "value": 0.85,
            "comment": "Exhaust is very effective against Zyra, as it reduces her burst damage significantly. Applying **Exhaust** during her **Stranglethorns (R)** or when she tries to poke with her **Grasping Roots (Q)** and **Deadly Spines (E)** will lower her damage output, allowing you to survive longer in fights. It's especially useful when you engage and she tries to burst you with her abilities."

            "value": "Against Zyra, focus on avoiding her crowd control, particularly her **Grasping Roots (Q)** and **Stranglethorns (R)**. Use **Flash** to dodge her key abilities, and try to engage after she uses her **Grasping Roots (Q)**, as it has a relatively long cooldown. **Exhaust** is essential to reduce her burst damage during all-ins, while **Ignite** helps prevent her healing and secures kills after engaging. Be patient and wait for her to overextend before you engage."

Zyra can poke effectively and disrupt your engage with her crowd control, but **Alistar**'s strong crowd control and sustain with **Exhaust** and **Ignite** can mitigate her threat. If you dodge her abilities and engage on her after she uses her crowd control, you can lock her down and take advantage of her squishiness."
